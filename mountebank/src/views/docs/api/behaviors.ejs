<h1>Stub Behaviors</h1>

<p>Stubs can be decorated by adding a <code>_behaviors</code> object.  At the moment, mountebank accepts
the following behaviors</p>

<table id='behaviors'>
  <tr>
    <th>Behavior</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>wait</code></td>
    <td>Adds latency to a response by waiting a specified number of milliseconds before sending
      the response.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>decorate</code></td>
    <td>Post-processes the response before sending it.  Since post-processing requires JavaScript
      injection, the <code><a href='/docs/commandLine'>--allowInjection</a></code> flag must be passed.
      Post-processing opens up a world of opportunities - you can use a <code>decorate</code> behavior
      to add data to a proxied response or substitute data from the request into the response, for
      example.  The value passed into the <code>decorate</code> behavior is a JavaScript function that
      can take up to three values: the request, the response, and a logger.  You can either mutate the
      response passed in (and return nothing), or return an altogether new response.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>repeat</code></td>
        <td>Repeat a response only a set number of times.  When this is set, Mountebank will not cycle
            through multiple responses as normal and instead will return this response until the number of repeats has
            been exhausted.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Multiple behaviors can be added to a response.  However, only one of each type of behavior
can exist on a single response.</p>
